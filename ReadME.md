# Guideline
## Version control
For EVERYONE:

1. Clone and deploy the project into your local machine.
2. Take tasks from Jira
3. Each member opens a new branch for the work he is working on.
4. Implement and test on your own.
5. Commit and push the changes to your branches and sent pull request. After the pull request is approved, delete your branch and check Jira tasks.
6. Make sure Master is working and go back to 2.

Use issues and milestones feature of Jira for progress tracking
